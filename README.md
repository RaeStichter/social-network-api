# Social Network API


### Description
_____________________________
Social networks are extremely common for people to use as a form of communication and broadcasting.  This project sets up the basic backend structure of a social network by utilizing the idea of users, friends, thoughts and reactions.

This project does not have a front end and must be tested through a program like Insomnia for route testing.

This project was developed using node, mongoose, moment, express and Insomnia for testing.
